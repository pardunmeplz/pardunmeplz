# 👋 hi

I like pulling systems apart and rebuilding smaller, worse versions of them
until they make sense.

## 🔬 things I think are cool

- language runtimes & interpreters  
- parsers, state machines, and protocols  
- editor tooling
- framework internals
- game dev

If any of that sounds fun, feel free to reach out.
If not, hit me up anyways.
